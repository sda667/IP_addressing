# IP Addressing and Static Routing

This project covers **IP addressing configuration** and **static routing** in a small network topology.  
It uses diagnostic tools such as ping and traceroute to validate connectivity and analyzes router behavior when forwarding packets.

## Project Structure
- `IP_addressing.pdf` → Full detailed lab report
- `IP_addressing.md` → Markdown version of the report

## Tools
- Linux networking stack
- Ping, traceroute
- Static routing configuration (`ip route`)

## Key Results
- Successful IP addressing and subnetting across multiple hosts.  
- Static routing ensures connectivity across extended topologies.  
- Routers decrement TTL and recompute checksums when forwarding packets.  
- Longest prefix match determines routing decisions.
